## Blog-Style website introducing HTML and CSS for beginners

[Live Website Link](https://zaeyyd.github.io/WebDevBlog)

* Sections of the website are divided into "DAYS". 

* I learn new HTML/CSS concepts every DAY, and then use those new concepts to code the next DAY. 

* Each DAY has information on how to code that DAY... kind of meta :o
